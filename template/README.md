# A new connector

A connector is a small folder: `src/main.ts`, what the connector is and what one run reads from its vendor, beside the type it writes and any helpers its vendor needs. The kit, `@withmarfa/connector`, does the rest:

- registers the connector on every start;
- checks its type against the instance's;
- compares what the run found with the rows already written, and writes only what changed;
- heartbeats, keeps the connector's state, and reports each run.

## Start one

1. `cp -R template/connector connectors/<name>`, and set `name` in its `package.json` to `<name>`. The folder sits at a connector's depth, so its paths hold once copied.
2. Add `{ "path": "connectors/<name>" }` to the references in the root `tsconfig.json`. Until it is there, the tree test fails `pnpm test`, since the build would skip the connector.
3. Replace `src/example.item.json` with the type the connector writes, and in `src/main.ts` name the connector, its source and that type, declare the environment it needs, and write `run`. Where the vendor's rows read as a core type, such as a task or a bookmark, the type names that core type as its `parent` and adds only the vendor's own fields, and `run` writes the core type's fields under the core type's names; `compatible_with` is not used.
4. `test/connector.test.ts` runs the example as a process against a scripted server and a stub vendor. Rewrite it for yours.
5. `pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm test`.

What a run has to hand:

- **`upsert(entries)`**: each entry is a `source_id`, its properties and its `occurred_at`. Put the vendor account inside the `source_id`, as `<account>:<id>`, so two accounts under one source never share a row. A property that is absent or `null` is cleared from the row.
- **`archive(sourceIds)`**: for what the vendor deleted. A row is archived, never trashed, and a row a person trashed is never touched.
- **`state.get` and `state.set`**: a small value kept between runs, such as a sync token. It is kept only when every write in the run landed, in a file in `MARFA_STATE_DIR` named for the key's own source, so two accounts' connectors can share the directory. The state is a cache: losing it costs a full read and never a duplicate, and a trashed row stays in the bin. Nothing remembers a row a person purged, so the vendor's copy is written again the next time the vendor sends it, as it does after the state is lost. Keep `MARFA_STATE_DIR` on a disk that lasts, or every run is a full read.
- **`log.condition(key, message)`**: something that lasts across runs but lets the run go on, such as a feed that stopped answering among several. It is reported on the first run it appears. What stops the run, such as a vendor refusing the token, is thrown instead, and fails the run.
- **`signal`**: hand it to `fetch`, so a stop is prompt.
- **`env`**: the values the connector declared. A `secret` or `required` value that is missing stops the start, and a secret never reaches a log line or a report. A secret that holds a list, such as several addresses, is also kept out part by part, where each part is set apart by whitespace or commas and is at least eight characters long. A value the connector can tell is wrong on sight, such as a malformed address, is refused by throwing from `checkEnv`, which stops the start the same way.

A connector reads from its vendor and never writes to it, and it writes only its own type at the feed tier. Promoting a row into the library is a person's or an app's act.

## The key

One key per connector per account, minted with the `marfa` binary by a credential that holds `keys.mint`:

```bash
marfa keys create --label <name> --source <name> --type-permission <type>=write --metadata-permission types=write --default-tier feed
```

- `--source <name>`: the connector's source, which every row it writes carries.
- `--type-permission <type>=write`: reach on the connector's own type and on nothing else.
- `--metadata-permission types=write`: lets it register its type on its first start.
- `--default-tier feed`: puts what it writes in the feed.

"One key per connector per account" means a second account's key carries its own source and claims the connector's. A key's own source is unique among live keys, so the second key takes `<name>-<account>` as its own and claims `<name>`, which the kit names on every write:

```bash
marfa keys create --label <name>-<account> --source <name>-<account> --claim <name> --type-permission <type>=write --metadata-permission types=write --default-tier feed
```

`types=write` is used only when this account's process is the first to start and so registers the type; once the type is on the instance, the key never uses it. Mint the key with the operator key. A working key can pass on only the sources it writes under itself, its own and its claims, so even one holding every permission is refused `<name>`; the operator key is exempt, which is how a claim starts. The two keys then write under one source, each account's rows kept apart by the account inside the `source_id`, and each keeps its own state file.

## Run it

The environment is `MARFA_URL`, `MARFA_KEY`, `MARFA_STATE_DIR` and whatever `env` declares.

- **`node dist/main.js --once`**: one run, then exit, for launchd, cron or a scheduled container. Exit codes: `0` for a run that succeeded or a clean stop, `1` for a failed run or a start that could not complete, `2` for a missing or malformed setting.
- **`node dist/main.js --every 15m`**: a long-lived process. Runs never overlap, and the heartbeat has its own one-minute timer. A failed run is reported, and the next waits twice as long, up to eight intervals. SIGTERM stops it cleanly.

### launchd

`launchd.plist.example` runs the connector `--once` every fifteen minutes. Copy it to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, give it a label and the real paths, and load it with `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) <plist>`. Its `ProgramArguments` start the connector under a secrets tool, so the key and the vendor's token never sit in the plist.

### A container

`Dockerfile` builds an image that runs one connector `--every 15m`. Build it from the repository root, once `scripts/monorepo.sh` and `scripts/vendor-client.sh` have packed the client:

```bash
docker build -f template/Dockerfile --build-arg CONNECTOR=<name> -t <name> .
```

Pass the environment with `-e`, and keep the state on a named volume, `-v <name>-state:/state`: the image sets `MARFA_STATE_DIR` to `/state`, and a container started without the volume begins with a full read of the vendor.
